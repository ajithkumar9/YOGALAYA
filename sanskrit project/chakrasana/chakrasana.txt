Chakrasana – The Wheel Pose
Chakrasana or the wheel pose is a backward bending yoga asana. Chakra in sanskrit means Wheel and Asana means a pose. In Chakrasana, the final position looks like a wheel, hence the name. This posture gives great flexibility to the spine and strengthens the arms, shoulders and the back muscles.


How to do Chakrasana (Wheel Pose)?
Lie down on your back with hands on the side.
Bend your knees and bring your heels as close to the buttocks as possible. The heels should be about 1 foot apart.
Now raise your hands and bring it back next to the ears. Place the palms on the floor with the fingers pointing towards the shoulders.
Lift your body up with the support of the palms and the feet.
Rotate the head slightly, so that your gaze is towards the floor.
Stretch your thighs and shoulders. In the final position your body looks like an arch, almost like a wheel.
Maintain this position, according to your capacity.
To release the position, lower your body till it touches the ground. Straighten your legs. Hands can go back to the original position to the sides.
It should be followed by forward bending poses to counteract the pressure created by the back bend.
