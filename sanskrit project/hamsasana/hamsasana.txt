Hamsasana – The Swan Pose
Hamsasana or “Swan Pose” is a yoga asana which resembles a swan when performed. Benefits of Hamsasana range from improved digestion to strengthening of the arms and abdominal muscles. In Sanskrit, ‘Hamsa’ means the swan and hence the name Hamsasana.


How to do Hamsasana (The Swan Pose)
Hamsasana should be performed on an empty stomach. Make sure there is a gap of 4 to 5 hours after a heavy meal.
Assume the kneeling position with the legs slightly apart.
Keep both the hands between the knees on the ground. The hands should point backwards towards the legs.
Rest your elbows on your abdomen. Let your abdominal muscles assume the weight of the upper body. The elbows should be kept together.
Take the legs backwards in a full stretch, one at a time.
Make the body straight like a plank and use the toes to balance the weight of your legs. Keep the legs together.
The body should be straight and make sure that your knees are not bent.
In the final position, the entire weight of the body is supported by the toes and the palms on the ground.
Head and neck should be kept straight to be in line with the body.
In the beginning you may try this position for 10 – 30 seconds. Once you are comfortable, you may increase it as per your capacity.
Keep your awareness on the abdomen and breathe normally.
