Shavasana – Corpse Pose – Yoga Asana for Relaxation
Shavasana, the corpse pose is a yogic relaxation pose. The name comes from the sanskrit words Shava meaning “corpse” and Asana meaning “posture”. Shavasana is the simplest and the main relaxation pose used in yoga. It is usually performed at the beginning and at the end of yoga practices. It is also used as a resting pose between other yoga asanas.
In Shavasana, emphasis is given to slow, rhythmic and relaxed breathing. The yogic breath is a complete breath done with full awareness. The abdomen, the chest and the neck (clavicular region) expands during a relaxed deep breath. As one relaxes more, the abdominal breathing is more prominent. We may have the habit of breathing from the chest and neck region when we are tense. You may observe that when we are relaxed, the abdominal breathing takes over.

How to do Shavasana?
Lie down on the floor on your back.
Place your hands next to the body, slightly spread out with palms facing upwards.
Spread your legs at a slight angle and feel as relaxed as possible.
Consciously relax all the muscles in your body from head to toe.
Let your breathing be slow and deep.  Focus your attention on your belly and observe the slow and rhythmic abdominal breathing.
You can maintain this position for as long as you need ranging from 5 – 30 minutes. Make sure you don’t sleep during the process.
